Mixin Problem

Without the use of a mixin, the following code in the default_project works:
abstract class ProjectGen extends ConceptEntity<Project> { 

With the use of mixin, there is a problem, without an error message, 
with the exit code=139 on Ubuntu and the exit code=-1073741819 on Windows 7.
abstract class ProjectGen extends Object with ConceptEntity<Project> { 
 
The restrictions on the ConceptEntity mixin in dartling are fulfilled:
ConceptEntity does not declare a constructor.
Its superclass is Object.
It does not ontain calls to super.
